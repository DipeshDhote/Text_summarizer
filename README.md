# Automated Text Summarizer

## Overview

The **Automated Text Summarizer** is a machine learning-based project designed to generate concise summaries of input text. The primary goal is to reduce lengthy documents or articles into shorter versions while retaining the essential meaning and key points.

## Features
- Summarizes long text documents into short, meaningful summaries.
- Supports both **abstractive** and **extractive** summarization techniques.
- User-friendly interface for inputting text or uploading documents.
- Customizable parameters for summarization length and style.
- Pre-trained language models for accurate summarization.
- Option to save summaries to a file.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language
- **Python**

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **spaCy**: Linguistic features like Part-of-Speech tagging.
- **Transformers** (Hugging Face): Pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT.
- **Flask/Django**: Web interface (optional).
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Model training and inference.

### Additional Tools
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Visualizing summarization statistics (optional).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and development.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following software is installed on your system:
- Python 3.10 or later
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment tools (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DipeshDhote/Text_summarizer
   cd text-summarizer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the necessary pre-trained models (e.g., from Hugging Face):
   ```bash
   python download_models.py
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface
1. Input text directly via the terminal:
   ```bash
   python summarizer.py --text "Your input text here."
   ```

2. Provide a text file:
   ```bash
   python summarizer.py --file input.txt
   ```

3. Specify output length:
   ```bash
   python summarizer.py --text "Your input text here." --length 50
   ```

### Web Interface (Optional)
1. Start the web application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
3. Paste text or upload a document to summarize.
4. View and save the generated summary.

## Examples

### Input
**Text:**
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world, enabling new possibilities in healthcare, education, transportation, and more. It empowers machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics."

### Output
**Summary:**
"AI is revolutionizing fields like healthcare, education, and transportation by enabling machines to perform intelligent tasks."

## Customization
1. Modify model parameters in `config.py` for different summarization styles.
2. Experiment with different pre-trained models (e.g., T5, BART).
3. Fine-tune models on domain-specific datasets for better results.

## Limitations
- May struggle with very technical or domain-specific language.
- Quality of the summary depends on the quality and diversity of the training data.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for multilingual summarization.
- Improve handling of highly technical content.
- Incorporate user feedback to fine-tune summaries dynamically.
- Enable summarization of multimedia content (e.g., videos, audio).
